= Using menus =

== Global menu == 

The template looks for a file/page called `mainmenu` to in the site root (`http://<my site>/mainmenu`). If present, the file will be used as a global menu throughout the site.

== Namespace menus == 

If present, namespace menus will appear beneath the global menu. The template expects these files/pages to called `menu` and to be placed in the namespace/folder where they are to be displayed. 

A namespace menu will be inherited until an namespace further down in the hierarchy declares a new menu. The new menu will then replace the old one in the left hand column.  

_Tip: A namespace menu might contain only whitespace, if it's only purpose is to stop the previous menu from being displayed._

== Menu syntax == 

Menus are expected to contain *only* a level 2 heading and an unordered list of links. Anything else could/will break the layout. 

Expanding menus are created using nested levels of unordered lists, and will be expanded automatically when the page they appear beneath is active.

{{{
===== My menu =====

  * [[first|First menu item]]
    * [[firstsub|Sub item of the first]]
  * [[second|Second menu item]]

}}}

The file names `mainmenu` and `menu` are configurable in the "Template settings" section.

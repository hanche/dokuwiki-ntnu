# dokuwiki-ntnu
Automatically exported from code.google.com/p/dokuwiki-ntnu

The project is unlikely to be of interest to anybody outside of NTNU
(Norwegian University of Science and Technology, if you must know).
It contains templates for dokuwiki sites within NTNU, as well as some useful (to us) additions.

It is the creation of Rune Andersen, mostly, and has been moved here for safe keeping
now that google code is going away.
